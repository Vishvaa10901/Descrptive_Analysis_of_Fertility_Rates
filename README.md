## **Note:**  
  I have uploaded my project as pdf due to large number of graphs and images which are combined with plain text. And for the sake of understanding and view, I found it better. I will soon upload the better version of my project in HTML or Markdown project.

### Description:
  The project is about the fertility rates of about 250 countries across the world from year 1950 to 2010.
  The dataset can be downloaded from here as well as the UN data website. (https://data.un.org/)
 
  The project is done using Jupyter Notebook installed in my pc.
  It would be my pleasure if my project gets helpful to the one who is interested.
